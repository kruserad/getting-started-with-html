  <em>How does the web work?</em>
</p>Say I type in www.espn.com to check the score of the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/275/">Wisconsin Badger</a> game.
My computer sends a request to a server. The server finds the HTML document I've requested,
and sends it back to my web browser, which then interprets the document and displays the information on my screen.<p><em>What is HTML?</em></p>
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. These documents are the majority of what you see on the web.
HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". 
<p><em>How do computers interpret information we give them?</em></p>
As our instructor stated, "computers are stupid." What he meant is that computers
take the instructions we give them literally. This can make a tiny mistake into a huge problem,
but it also gives us powerful control over what we can instruct them to do.
<p><em>What are tags and elements?</em></p>
HTML documents are made of elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers
the type of each element by using tags. To make matters even more confusing,
there are two different types of elements: inline and block. A much more detailed description
can be found by clicking <a href="www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723438">here</a>.
